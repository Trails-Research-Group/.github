## The group
This group is made of modders of the Trails games who aim to make modding accessible to everyone. 
Our goal is to offer a quick presentation of the modding scene, including available tools, guides and general documentation that has been established over the years.
We will also try to promote the work of other modders as much as possible, be it tools or actual mods.

The main repository where we collect this information is: https://github.com/Trails-Research-Group/Doc

The philosophy of our group is that we don't answer questions directly, but will consider writing a guide so that we don't have to repeat ourselves, as the questions in the modding community usually end up being more or less the same every time. And this is due to the fact that barely anyone documents their work among the modders and tool makers.
