## The group
This group is made of modders of the Trails games who aim to make modding accessible to everyone. 
Our goal is to offer a quick presentation of the modding scene, including available tools, guides and general documentation that has been established over the years.
We will also try to promote the work of other modders as much as possible, be it tools or actual mods.
