## The group
This group is made of modders of the Trails games who aim to make modding accessible to everyone. 
Our goal is to offer a quick presentation of the modding scene, including available tools, guides and general documentation that has been established over the years.
We will also try to promote the work of other modders as much as possible, be it tools or actual mods.

## Getting started with modding the Trails series
## What is currently doable
We define a difficulty scale for each item which reads like this:

☆☆☆☆☆ : straightforward, nothing difficult, takes literal minutes to be done\
★☆☆☆☆ : simple manipulation, no or very little coding background required\
★★☆☆☆ : a little more advanced, usually involves setting up a special environment like Python\
★★★☆☆ : a bit hard but still manageable for someone who has some background in programming and can interpret binary data\
★★★★☆ : pretty hard. not accessible to everyone. little to no documentation exist. A tool might exist but it is very rough or prone to cause errors\
★★★★★ : either a very difficult process with many complex and time consuming steps, or no tool exists for that specific purpose and you're on your own

**Trails in the Sky series**\
Event editing: difficulty: ★★☆☆☆ [FC, SC, 3rd]
