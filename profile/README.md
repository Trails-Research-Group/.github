## The group
This group is made of modders of the Trails games who aim to make modding accessible to everyone. 
Our goal is to offer a quick presentation of the modding scene, including available tools, guides and general documentation that has been established over the years.
We will also try to promote the work of other modders as much as possible, be it tools or actual mods.

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
