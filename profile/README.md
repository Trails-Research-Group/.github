## The group
This group is made of modders of the Trails games who aim to make modding accessible to everyone. 
Our goal is to offer a quick presentation of the modding scene, including available tools, guides and general documentation that has been established over the years.
We will also try to promote the work of other modders as much as possible, be it tools or actual mods.

The philosophy of our group is that we don't answer questions directly, but will consider writing a guide so that we don't have to repeat ourselves, as the questions in the modding community usually end up being more or less the same every time. And this is due to the fact that barely anyone documents their work among the modders and tool makers.

## To newcomers
To people wanting to get into modding the Trails games, you might want to start looking at the "What is currently doable" section, which will give you hints on what you can currently achieve with the limited knowledge you have (as a newcomer to the scene), as well as guides and tools to achieve your goals. 

Please also have a look at the FAQ section which contains the most frequently asked questions regarding mods, there is a good chance you will find your answer there. Finally, if nothing here helps, please feel free to drop by the various modding discords, forums and communities and ask your question there.

## What is currently doable
We define a difficulty scale for each item which reads like this:

☆☆☆☆☆ : straightforward, nothing difficult, takes literal minutes to be done\
★☆☆☆☆ : simple manipulation, no or very little coding background required\
★★☆☆☆ : a little more advanced, usually involves setting up a special environment like Python\
★★★☆☆ : a bit hard but still manageable for someone who has some background in programming and can interpret binary data\
★★★★☆ : pretty hard. not accessible to everyone. little to no documentation exist. A tool might exist but it is very rough\
★★★★★ : either a very difficult process with many complex and time consuming steps, or no tool exists (to our knowledge), you're on your own
